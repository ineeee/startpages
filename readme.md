## startpages
i want to learn and exercise html5/css3 so i decided to copy every startpage i see with fancy new features. everything in the code is probably going to look the same.

also i only care about the newest desktop firefox/chrome, and internationalization/localization, accesibility, social media tags, search engine optimization are out of scope.
